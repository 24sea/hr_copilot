## Limitations :

- **Mock/Simplified Data:** The current version uses sample employee and leave data. Future versions can integrate directly with enterprise HRMS/ERP systems for real-time information.  
- **Authentication:** Basic authentication only. Secure enterprise authentication such as SSO or JWT can be added.  
- **NLP Support:** The chatbot currently supports English. Expanding to multiple languages will make the assistant more inclusive.  
- **Policy Coverage:** Only basic HR policies are included. Broader coverage (payroll, reimbursements, benefits, training) can be added in later versions.  
- **Scalability:** Current app is suitable for demo scale. Future work can include containerization (Docker/Kubernetes) and deployment on cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP) for large-scale usage.  
- **User Experience:** The UI is functional but basic. Enhancements like mobile-friendly design, dark mode, and voice input can improve adoption.
